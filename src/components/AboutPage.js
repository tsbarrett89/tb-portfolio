            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a husband and father of four living in beautiful Missoula, MT. My interest in computer coding started years ago while I was searching for a career but I did not decide to make a concerted effort to learn until about a year ago. During the summer of 2019 I heard about Lambda School and was grateful to find a learning environment that could provide me necessary structure and fit my financial needs.</p>
            <p>I became a Full Stack Developer in four months, but there is so much to continue learning and growth opportunites present themselves daily. My study environment provided an ability to learn the latest technical skills, but also the communication, teamwork, and colloboration that allows those technical skills to produce cohesive projects.</p>
            <p>At the end of my first four months I was fortunately selected as a Team Lead (TL), which provided the opportunity to further my education while guiding new students along their journey. My communication, teamwork, and collobartive skills were strengthened as part of a group of TLs that strive daily to enhance the student experience and foster a strong learning environment. My team of students are now Full Stack Developers themselves!</p>
            <p>Between studying, challenges, and responsibilities of everyday life I enjoy various forms of gaming. From regular Dungeons and Dragons games to board games with my family, what I enjoy the most is creating and implementing strategies. The problem solving and critical thinking required is just another reason I am so grateful for the career as a Web Developer. I also enjoy the outdoors, and I regret how little I take advantage of the abundant outdoor opportunities surrounding me here in Montana.</p>
